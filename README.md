📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how CNNs can be applied for image classification tasks.
The model is trained to classify handwritten digits into 10 categories (0–9) and is deployed with a Streamlit UI for interactive use.

Features:

📸 Upload or capture handwritten digit images.

🔢 Predict digits in real-time.

⚡ Fast and lightweight model (trained using TensorFlow/Keras).

🌐 Deployed on Hugging Face Spaces with an intuitive web interface.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Python 3.9+

TensorFlow / Keras (Model training)

NumPy, Pandas (Data handling)

Matplotlib / Seaborn (Visualization)
